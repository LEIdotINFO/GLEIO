# GLEIO

General Legal Entity Identifier Ontology (GLEIO) is a concrete RDF/OWL specification of LEI data that is not only compliant with LEI Common Data File Format (LEI CDF) but also allows for representation of changes of LEI and the related LEI reference data over time.

Creating the ontology, we focused on benefits that can be gained by using semantic representation. Among them are: 

- clear semantics of the LEI data, 
- global persistent identification of the entities allowing for dereferencing URIs and retrieving information about the entities, 
- flexibility of the representation allowing for easy extensibility (e.g., in the scope of Linked Open Data environment), 
- possibility of using the content negotiation mechanism and finally, 
- easy accessing and sharing of current and historical LEI data by the SPARQL endpoint.

The ontology documentation is available at: [http://lei.info/gleio/](http://lei.info/gleio/). All the terms that the ontology defines can be used directly in your browser to obtain their definitions. 

It is worth noting that the GLEIO Ontology was appreciated by the organizers of 9th IAOA International Conference on Formal Ontology in Information Systems (FOIS 2016) were it won the runner-up position. The competition paper is available from CEUR Workshop Proceedings.
